Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, albumen, and vitellus, contained within various thin membranes. Popular choices for egg consumption are chicken, duck, quail, roe, and caviar, but the egg most often consumed by humans is the chicken egg, by a wide margin.\nEgg yolks and whole eggs store significant amounts of protein and choline, and are widely used in cookery. Due to their protein content, the United States Department of Agriculture categorizes eggs as Meats within the Food Guide Pyramid. Despite the nutritional value of eggs, there are some potential health issues arising from egg quality, storage, and individual allergies.\nChickens and other egg-laying creatures are widely kept throughout the world, and mass production of chicken eggs is a global industry. In 2009, an estimated 62.1 million metric tons of eggs were produced worldwide from a total laying flock of approximately 6.4 billion hens. There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation, as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production. The European Union recently bannned battery husbandry of chickens."@en

The city's natural harbour first attracted the French explorer La Salle, who named the site \"The Rapids\" when he had horses and men pull his 45-tonne barque \"Le Griffon\" up the almost four-knot current of the St. Clair River on 23 August 1679.\nThis was the first time anything other than a canoe or other oar-powered vessel had sailed into Lake Huron, and La Salle's voyage was thus germinal in the development of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes. Located in the natural harbour, the Sarnia port remains an important centre for lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum products. The natural port and the salt caverns that exist in the surrounding areas, together with the oil discovered in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 led to the massive growth of the petroleum industry in this area. Because Oil Springs was the first place in Canada and North America to drill commercially for oil, the knowledge that was acquired there led to oil drillers from Sarnia travelling the world teaching other nations how to drill for oil."@en

It is the eighth film produced by Pixar, and was co-written and directed by Brad Bird, who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005. The title refers to a French dish, \"ratatouille\", which is served at the end of the film, and is also a play on words about the species of the main character. The film stars the voices of Patton Oswalt as Remy, an anthropomorphic rat who is interested in cooking; Lou Romano as Linguini, a young garbage boy who befriends Remy; Ian Holm as Skinner, the head chef of Auguste Gusteau's restaurant; Janeane Garofalo as Colette, a r√¥tisseur at Gusteau's restaurant; Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego, a restaurant critic; Brian Dennehy as Django, Remy's father and leader of his clan; Peter Sohn as Emile, Remy's older brother; and Brad Garrett as Auguste Gusteau, a recently deceased chef. The plot follows Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant's garbage boy.\nDevelopment of Ratatouille began in 2001 when Pinkava wrote the original concepts of the film. In 2005, Bird was approached to direct the film and revised the story. Bird and some of the film's crew members also visited Paris for inspiration. To create the food animations used in the film, the crew consulted chefs from both France and the United States. Bird also interned at Thomas Keller's French Laundry restaurant, where Keller developed the confit byaldi, a dish used in the film. Ratatouille premiered on June 22, 2007 at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, California, and had its general release on June 29, 2007 in the United States. The film grossed $623.7 million at the box office and received critical acclaim. The film later won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, among other honors."@en

To date, Retro Hugo awards have been given for novelettes for 1946, 1951, and 1954.\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the award presentation constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with five nominees, except in the case of a tie. These five novelettes on the ballot are the five most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of five nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.

The show's title sequence features an instrumental version of \"Suicide Is Painless\", the theme song from the original film. The show was created after an attempt to film the original book's sequel, M*A*S*H Goes to Maine, failed. The T.V show version of MASH is the most well known version of the M*A*S*H works, and one of the highest rated shows in U.S. television history.\nThe series premiered in the U.S. on September 17, 1972, and ended February 28, 1983, with the finale, \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", becoming the most watched television episode in U.S. television history at the time, with a record-breaking 125 million viewers, according to the New York Times. It had struggled in its first season and was at risk of being cancelled. Season two of M*A*S*H placed it in a better time slot; the show became one of the top ten programs of the year and stayed in the top twenty programs for the rest of its eleven-season run.

/m/01rqxn	"The National Assembly is the lower house of the bicameral Parliament of France under the Fifth Republic. The upper house is the Senate. The National Assembly's members are known as d√©put√©s.\nThere are 577 d√©put√©s, each elected by a single-member constituency through a two-rounds system. 289 seats are therefore required for a majority. The assembly is presided over by a president, normally from the largest party represented, assisted by vice-presidents from across the represented political spectrum. The term of the National Assembly is five years; however, the President of the Republic may dissolve the Assembly unless he has dissolved it in the preceding twelve months. This measure is becoming rarer since the 2000 referendum reduced the President's term from seven to five years: a President usually has a majority elected in the Assembly two months after him, and it would be useless for him to dissolve it for those reasons.\nFollowing a tradition started by the first National Assembly during the French Revolution, the \"left-wing\" parties sit to the left as seen from the president's seat, and the \"right-wing\" parties sit to the right, and the seating arrangement thus directly indicates the political spectrum as represented in the Assembly. The official seat of the National Assembly is the Palais Bourbon on the banks of the river Seine; the Assembly also uses other neighbouring buildings, including the Immeuble Chaban-Delmas on the rue de l'Universit√©.

The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches in diameter and 10 feet high mounted to a backboard at each end. Basketball is one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.\nA team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket during regular play. A field goal scores two points for the shooting team if a player is touching or closer to the basket than the three-point line, and three points if the player is behind the three-point line. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but additional time may be issued when the game ends with a draw. The ball can be advanced on the court by bouncing it while walking or running or throwing it to a team mate. It is a violation to move without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.\nViolations are called \"fouls\". A personal foul is penalized, and a free throw is usually awarded to an offensive player if he is fouled while shooting the ball. A technical foul may also be issued when certain infractions occur, most commonly for unsportsmanlike conduct on the part of a player or coach. A technical foul gives the opposing team a free throw, and the opposing team also retains possession of the ball."@en

They play in the Campeonato Baiano, Bahia's state league, and the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A, Brazil's national league.\nBahia has won the Brasileir√£o title twice: in the 1959 season, defeating Santos' Sant√°sticos which contained figures such as Gilmar, Mauro, Meng√°lvio, Coutinho, Pepe and Pel√©, in the finals and in the 1988 season Bahia edged Internacional. Bahia has only appeared in the Copa Libertadores three times, reaching the quarterfinals in 1989, Bahia's best ever performance. The club has also won their state title a record 44 times.\nThe 2000s has been a dark age for the club as they have only won one state title. Furthermore, Bahia were relegated to S√©rie B in 2003 and relegated, for the first time ever, to S√©rie C in 2005, spending two seasons at the bottom of the Brazilian League System. In 2007, they were promoted back to the second level and, after a great campaign in 2010, the club found themselves back to S√©rie A after eight seasons. Bahia played their home games at the 66,080 capacity Est√°dio Fonte Nova since 1951, but, after the disaster that occurred at the stadium in 2007, the Tricolor have played at the Est√°dio de Pitua√ßu. With the re-opening of the Fonte Nova stadium in 2013 as the Arena Fonte Nova, a modern arena built for the 2014 Fifa World Cup, Bahia switched its home stadium back to the old and beloved place. Their traditional home kit consists of white shirts with blue shorts and red socks. The club has a long-standing rivalry with national opponents Esporte Clube Vit√≥ria, and matches between the two sides are known as the Ba‚ÄìVi."@en

The Islanders are one of three NHL franchises in the New York City metropolitan area along with the New Jersey Devils and the New York Rangers, with the Islanders' primary fan base being suburban Long Island. The Islanders have a rivalry with the Rangers referred to as the Battle of New York.\nThe team was founded in 1972 as part of the NHL's maneuvers to keep a team from the rival World Hockey Association out of Nassau Coliseum, and found almost instant success by securing fourteen straight playoff berths starting with their third season. The Islanders won four consecutive Stanley Cup championships between 1980 and 1983, the seventh of eight dynasties recognized by the NHL in its history. Also between 1980 and 1984 they won 19 consecutive playoff series, a feat still unparalleled in the history of professional sports.\nSince the end of the dynasty the franchise has been plagued by money troubles, poor ownership and management, an aging arena, and low attendance. The woes have been reflected on the ice. Since 1987‚Äì88, the team has not won a division title, and their last playoff series win was during the 1992‚Äì93 NHL season. After 10 years of various failed attempts to rebuild or replace the Nassau Coliseum, the Islanders announced on October 24, 2012 that the franchise will be moving to the Barclays Center in the New York City borough of Brooklyn for the 2015‚Äì16 NHL season once their lease at the Coliseum expires."@en
